** Student Placement Prediction - Beginner ML Project**
This is a beginner-friendly machine learning project that analyzes and models a dataset related to student placements. The objective is to explore how factors like CGPA and IQ score influence placement outcomes and to build a predictive model using logistic regression.

** What This Project Covers**
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Understand the distribution and relationship between CGPA, IQ, and placement
Visualize trends and correlations using plots

Data Preprocessing:
Clean the dataset (removed index column)
Ensure correct data types and handle missing values (none in this dataset)

Model Building (Logistic Regression):
Built and trained a logistic regression model using scikit-learn
Used CGPA and IQ score as predictors to estimate placement status

** Dataset Summary**
The dataset placement.csv contains:
cgpa: Student’s academic performance
iq: Student’s IQ score
placement: Binary value indicating placement status (1 = Placed, 0 = Not Placed)

** Tools & Libraries Used**
Python
Pandas, NumPy – for data manipulation
Matplotlib, Seaborn – for visualization
Scikit-learn – for modeling and evaluation

** Goals**
Understand the basics of machine learning
Learn how to clean and prepare a dataset
Train and evaluate a simple classification model
Gain insights from real-world educational data
